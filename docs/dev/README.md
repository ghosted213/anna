# development

Tags denote releases.
Any commit merged to `main` is expected to be release ready,
with the exception of the `version` in `Cargo.toml`.
For more detail, see the [release process](#release-process).

Follows [semver](https://semver.org/):
- MAJOR version indicates a user facing breaking change.
- MINOR version indicates backwards compatible functionality improvement.
- PATCH version indicates backwards compatible bug fixes.

The initial beta releases use `0` as the major version; when this changes to `1`
it will not necessarily indicate a breaking change, but future major version increases will.

## compatibility

- Tracks the latest version of the Rust compiler and associated tooling at all times.
- Tracks the latest Rust language edition.
- Aggressively upgrades dependencies. Relies on testing to validate dependencies work.

## setting up your development environment

Recommend Visual Studio Code with the `rust-analyzer` extension.
Install Rust here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

These tools may be useful, although they're not required:
```
cargo nextest # https://nexte.st/
cargo upgrade # https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-upgrades
cargo machete # https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-machete
```

### cross compilation

Sometimes, especially when debugging a platform build issue, it's useful to "cross compile" the project
from your home operating system to a destination operating system.

Steps to do so are located in the [cross compilation reference](./reference/cross-compile.md).

## style guide

Make your code look like the code around it. Consistency is the name of the game.

You should submit changes to this doc if you think you can improve it,
or if a case should be covered by this doc, but currently is not.

Use `rustfmt` for formatting.
CI enforces that all changes pass a `rustfmt` run with no differences.
CI ensures that all patches pass `clippy` checks.

Comments should describe the "why", type signatures should describe the "what", and the code should describe the "how".

We use the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html)
during code review; if you want to get ahead of the curve check it out!

Ideally, every PR should check for updated dependencies and update them if applicable;
if this is not realistic at minimum every non-bugfix release **must** ensure dependencies are up to date.

## release process

> [!TIP]
> Requires `cargo-release` and `git-cliff` to be installed.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to have your changes integrate with the changelog,
> make sure to merge commits to `main` with a meaningful commit message.
>
> Additionally, if those commits are parseable as [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org),
> they will be grouped into sections in the changelog.
> See the `cliff.toml` file for more details and group examples.

Use `cargo release` to create a release.
Since we cannot push to `main` directly, perform the steps below:

```shell
# Choose a version. It should be valid semver.
# Also, choose a branch name. A good default is `prep/$VERSION`.
VERSION=<VERSION>
BRANCH="prep/$VERSION"

# Make a branch for release prep and check it out.
git checkout -b $BRANCH

# Have cargo-release create the release.
# This does several things:
# - Validates that the git index is clean
# - Updates version numbers in the crates
# - Generates the changelog using `git-cliff`
# - Creates a commit with the changes
# - Pushes the branch to the remote
cargo release --no-publish --no-tag --allow-branch=$BRANCH $VERSION

# Open a PR; once tests pass and reviewers approve, merge to main and come back here for the final step.
# The PR title should be "chore(release): $VERSION" or something that similarly avoids generating a changelog entry;
# see the `cliff.toml` file for more details.
gh pr create --base main --body-file .github/release_template.md --title "chore(release): $VERSION"

# Finally, run `cargo release` on the main branch.
# This doesn't create new commits; it just tags the commit and pushes the tag.
git checkout main
git pull
cargo release -x
```
